# Getting Started with COP React Design System
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following, all of which are call-throughs to the `packages/components` directory, which is where all of the components reside.

### `yarn storybook`

Runs Storybook, show casing the components in the library within a series of stories.\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn lint`

Runs `eslint` against your code, which will highlight any issues. Anything showing as a lint *error* must be addressed prior to committing; anything that's a *warning* should be addressed but is a lower priority.

Suppressing lint errors and warnings should only be done as a last resort and you should have a good justification for doing so.

### `yarn compile`

Builds the component library for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your component is ready to be consumed for a production environment!


# Roadmap

- Add documentation e.g `Docusaurus`
- Add components from https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/
