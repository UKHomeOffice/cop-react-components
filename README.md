# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn storybook`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn compile`

Builds the components for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React components in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your components are ready to be deployed!

See the section about [compile](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation) for more information.

### `yarn build-storybook`
Builds the storybook files ending in `.stories.mdx` to static HTML, CSS & JS files located in `storybook-static` folder.

### `yarn deploy-storybook`
Deploys the storybook build from the previous step to GitHub Pages. The storybook is deployed to special branch called `gh-pages`.\


The changes will be publicly available on [Cop React Components Storybook](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/cop-react-components)
