# Error summary

Use this component at the top of a page to summarise any errors a user has made.

When a user makes an error, you must show both an error summary and an error message next to each answer that contains an error.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story name="Default">
    <ErrorSummary errors={[
      { id: 'passportDate', error: 'The date your passport was issued must be in the past' },
      { id: 'postcode', error: 'Enter a postcode, like AA1 1AA' }
    ]} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={ ErrorSummary } />

# When to use this component

Always show an error summary when there is a validation error, even if there’s only one.

# How it works

You must:

* move keyboard focus to the error summary
* include the heading ‘There is a problem’
* link to each of the answers that have validation errors
* make sure the error messages in the error summary are worded the same as those which appear next to the inputs with errors

As well as showing an error summary, follow the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/validation/" target="_blank">validation pattern</a> - for example, by adding ‘Error: ’ to the beginning of the page `<title>` so screen readers read it out as soon as possible.

And make your <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/#be-clear-and-concise" target="_blank">error messages</a> clear and concise.
