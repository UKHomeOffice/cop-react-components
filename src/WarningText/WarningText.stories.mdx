# Warning text

Bold text with a warning symbol.

## One line

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <WarningText>
      You can be fined up to Â£5,000 if you do not register.
    </WarningText>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Wrapped text

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Long">
    <WarningText>
      A very long warning message. This includes a lot of text to give a good representation of a more average length
      warning. That way you can see more than one line wrapping.
    </WarningText>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## When to use this component

Use the warning text component when you need to warn users about something important, such as legal consequences of an action, or lack of action, that they might take.

## How it works

Use warning text very sparingly - it's less effective if it's overused.
