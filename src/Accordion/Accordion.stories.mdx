## When to use this component

Accordions are most appropriate when users will only need a few specific pieces of content within a page or if you have only a small space to display a lot of content.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the accordion component to hide information that the majority of your users will need.

## Details, accordions and tabs

Details, accordions, and tabs all hide sections of content which a user can choose to reveal.

Use the accordion component instead of details or tabs if you have multiple long sections of content.
